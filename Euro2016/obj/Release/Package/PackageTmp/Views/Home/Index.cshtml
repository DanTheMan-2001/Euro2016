<h2>Work Experience June 2016</h2>

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-6">
        <p>This week I have worked at RAPP. My task was to build this website, using SQL server and Visual Studio. I have used programming languages such as <strong>asp.net</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>css</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>.</p>
        
        
        <p>Programs that I have installed:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Visual Studio – Microsoft’s development environment for creating applications.</li>
            <li>SQL Server – Microsoft’s enterprise database platform.</li>
        </ul>


        <p>Databases:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A primary key is used to uniquely identify all table records.</li>
            <li>A foreign key is a field in a table linked to a record in another table, for example <strong>GroupId in the teams table is a foreign key to the group table.</strong></li>
        </ul>


        <p>Web Application:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Building a website using MVC (model view controller).</li>
            <li class="indentbullet">The model represents the data being displayed, for example a team.</li>
            <li class="indentbullet">The view is the user interface, for example the page that allows you to add or edit a team.</li>
            <li class="indentbullet">The controller works out the page and view to display.</li>
            <li>Entity framework – this maps our database tables into objects within our web application.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Building the website:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Using Visual Studio, I have made controllers, models and views for the different pages of my site. I have included css so that my website looks aesthetically pleasing and I have used data tables to store data allowing the user to search for certain data, and I have adapted this to suit my purpose in the layout.cshtml file.</li>
        </ul>
